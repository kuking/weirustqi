# WeiRustQi - Computer-GO library [<img src="https://travis-ci.org/kuking/weirustqi.svg?branch=master">](https://travis-ci.org/kuking/weirustqi)
Intended to be a fast, optimised and simple library for Computer GO in Rust.
It is a very long shot (the second one for me) in implementing a fast Go library
for supporting Monte Carlo and machine learning approaches. It also servers the
purpose of teaching me Rust.
